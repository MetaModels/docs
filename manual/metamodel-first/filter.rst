|img_filter_32| Filter sets
===========================

Setting up "filter sets" is an optional step. You can control different output parameters with this component. In this example we will set up a filter, which will allow us to show only entries which have the attribute "published" activated.

To do this, go to the MetaModels overview to see the entry "Employee list". Now click onto the icon "|img_filter| Define filters" and the view will switch to the overview of filters - at the moment it is still empty.

Click on the icon "|img_new| New" and the input screen for setting up a filter opens immediately. You just have to enter a name for the filter in the input field "Name" - e.g. "published" (see screenshot).

|img_filter_01_en|

Now you should be able to see your first entry "Published" in the filter overview -  see screenshot.

|img_filter_02_en|

Then click on the icon "|img_filter_setting| Define attribute setting" to open the next level for the filter attributes. Here you can configure the filter and its attributes. The filter attributes can be combined in different nestings and combinations. For our example we will need to add only one filter attribute to the filter by clicking on the icon "|img_new| New".

After the click you will first see only the clip folder icon |img_pasteinto| - click on this icon to open the configuration screen.

To filter by published state there is a special filter available in the select menu "Type" (see screenshot).

|img_filter_03_en|

Then click on "Enabled" and "Save and close" to finish the filter attribute setup. You should see the following list view now (see screenshot).

|img_filter_04_en|

Now the filter is defined and it can be activated for different components.
